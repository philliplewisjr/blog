					<li><h1>How to get started?!</h1>
					<p>Beginning your journey on the goal of developing a healthy mind is meditation. Try to start with the simplest form of the practice. We in this day and age want it right now and when it doesn't appear we are overwhelmed with grief. This cannot be one's approach to this "way of life." Five minute practices are better than no practice and one gradually progresses as honest assesment permits.</p>
					<br></li>

					<li><h2>Consistency</h2>
					<p>Out all that is suggested here this is the most important of all. Nothing is done better without practice. Your best friend is consistency, and is your very best when it is not convenient.</p>
					<br></li>

					<li><h2>Environment for Practice</h2>
					<p>One does not eat while sitting on the toilet and does not shower with muddy water. Where one places themselves for reflection is no different. The place must engender silence and cleanliness. Fish cannot swim without water and birds cannot fly without the sky.</p></li>

					<li><h2>Timing</h2>
					<p>Carving out time in the day is most advantageous. Regularity and commonality will keep you in rythm and balance.</p></li>

					<li><h4>Research</h4>
					<p>Reading is a good form of research but experience is as important. Linking up with communities that foster this lifestyle will be of great aid. Wondering alone in a forest searching for the panacea for one's mind can be a challenge. Having companions lightens the load and provides insight.</p></li>
